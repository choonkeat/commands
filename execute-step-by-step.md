$ARGUMENTS

1. Do the next pending step in the task file.
    - for any test or verification that you are doing, log the expected-and-gotten, i.e.
        - before doing it, echo {hhmmss in localtime}, what will be done, and what to expect >> tasks/{task filename}-{phase}.log and git commit it
        - after doing it, echo {hhmmss in localtime}, what you observed, and what you got (regardless of whether it was what we expected) >> tasks/{task filename}-{phase}.log and git commit it
2. After successfully completing a step
    2.1. verify tasks/{task filename}-{phase}.log against the task's list of mcp browser: if we did not get the expected outcome, echo {hhmmss in localtime}, redoing because {reasons} >> tasks/{task filename}-{phase}.log, git commit it and go back to redo (1)
    2.3. update the task file to indicate progress
    2.4. git commit only the relevant files (do not bluntly git add everything) with conventional commit message style (specifying it is phase n/m of this task)
3. Loop back to (1) unless there are no more pending steps in the task file.

When you're all done
- for each tasks/{task filename}-{phase}.log file
    - take me through its content (what you've done, problems encountered, and conclusion)
    - ask me if i'm ok before proceeding to the next file
- then commit only the relevant files (do not bluntly `git add -A` the whole pwd) with conventional commit message style and let me know the current git status after that.

If we need any excuses for any verification failing, please stop work and get my permission; do NOT plough on with compromises.
